# TrackMyBus
## <u>Story</u>
Buses take up over 90% of public transport in Indian cities, and serve as an important mode of transport. A large percentage of the people in our country rely on public bus to move between cities villages and also districts.
One of the major problems faced by people who rely on buses to travel is the difficulty to find the timing of buses and the basic information about route of the bus. Even though there are time tables at bus stops and website of the state governments have a website, the information there is limited and there won't be any notice if the bus is cancelled for the route or time. Because of all these reasons a lot of time is being wasted for no reason.

## <u>How it works?</u><br>
When a user enters the website and select their destination and current location, the website will provide the user with live location of the bus and details of the driver travelling to that destination that will pass by the user.The user will also get push notifications when the bus reaches closer to the user. <br>

## <u>Hmmm... So how driver's update the location?</u><br>
Login credentials are already given to verified drivers to avoid spamming.The bus driver login to the website from their phone and he/she will be asked to allow location access. Then they have to enter the starting point and destination of the route the bus is going to travel. The live location will be shared to the website.<br>

In this way people can know when a bus will reach them or where the bus has reached at a particular  time.<br>
