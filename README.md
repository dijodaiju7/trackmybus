## <u>Story</u>
Buses take up over 90% of public transport in Indian cities, and serve as an important mode of transport. A large percentage of the people in our country rely on public bus to move between cities villages and also districts.
One of the major problems faced by people who rely on buses to travel is the difficulty to find the timing of buses and the basic information about route of the bus. Even though there are time tables at bus stops and website of the state governments have a website, the information there is limited and there won't be any notice if the bus is cancelled for the route or time. Because of all these reasons a lot of time is being wasted for no reason.
